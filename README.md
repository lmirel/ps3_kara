Kara, a Karaoke game

use USB microphones to sing to your own tunes.

note that the videos you want to use should be copied in a folde called 'videos' on a FAT32 formatted USB drive.<br>
if you intend to use videos with no lyrics embedded in the stream, you can use SRT-type subtitles to add the lyrics in sync with the videos.<br>

very important: there is a limitation to the video format which can be used for playback: 720p MP4 videos ONLY.<br>
use Avidemux (version 2.7.4) to prep your videos to the requirements: from 'Auto' menu, choose '720p', then from the left-side toolbox choose 'AAC (lav)' for Audio and 'MP4 Muxer' for Output Format.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! and Enjoy!
